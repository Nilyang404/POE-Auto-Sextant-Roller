## POE-Auto-Sextant-Roller

#### Description

This script is a refactoring of a one of my AHK automation project. Implementing it in python makes it more readable and maintainable.
This script completely automizes the process of rolling sextants in POE, and it is able to run stably for more than 24 hours after launching. At the same time, it also integrates the functions of quickly filtering and fetch specific compasses, cleaning inventory, quick trading. It is not resolution adaptive, so the coordinates of the item slot should be configured in detail before use. It's essentially a sequence of target recognition, clicks, and key presses, it won't read or write any data in the RAM.

#### NOTE
This project is just my practice and experiment with pyautogui and multi-processing, 
For me, writing code is more fun than gaming, so I was AFK after completing the test.
I don't recommend anyone to use it in real games because it may violate the Term of Use of POE, which may get you banned.
